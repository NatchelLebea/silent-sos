#  SilentSOS ‚Äì Your Voice When You Can‚Äôt Speak

SilentSOS is a Flutter-based safety and emotional support application created in response to the alarming rise of gender-based violence in South Africa, where help often arrives *too late*.
The app empowers users to trigger SOS alerts, share live location, and access emotional guidance through an integrated AI support chatbot powered by Rasa.

# Motivation

Every day, countless women and vulnerable people in South Africa experience gender-based violence (GBV) ‚Äî and far too often, help arrives too late.
SilentSOS was built to change that by detecting distress, alerting loved ones instantly, and offering emotional support in moments of fear or trauma.

> ‚ÄúI built SilentSOS because I was tired of hearing stories that end with ‚Äòif only someone had known.‚Äô‚Äù
